# Sudoku-Generator
Possibly the fastest Sudoku Generator available as it hits 1000 puzzles generated in 2.5 seconds on outdated hardware (2017 laptop) in a Windows environment with system interrupts, task scheduling, and no dedicated threading. The benchmark was performed with O2 optimizations, where fastest time generated is 54µs.
